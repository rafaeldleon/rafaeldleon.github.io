In this extended abstract we present colored generalizations of the symmetric algebra and its 
Koszul dual, the exterior algebra. The symmetric group \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\) acts on the multilinear 
components of these algebras. While \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\) acts trivially on the multilinear components 
of the colored symmetric algebra, we use poset topology techniques to describe the representation 
on its Koszul dual. We introduce an \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-poset of weighted subsets that we call the 
weighted boolean algebra and we prove that the multilinear components of the colored exterior 
algebra are \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-isomorphic to the top cohomology modules of its maximal intervals.
We show that the two colored  Koszul dual algebras are Koszul in the sense of Priddy et al.
