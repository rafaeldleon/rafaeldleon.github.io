In this extended abstract we consider the poset of weighted partitions \\(\Pi_n^w\\),  introduced by Dotsenko and Khoroshkin in  their study of a certain pair of dual operads. The maximal intervals of   \\(\Pi_n\\) provide a generalization of the lattice  \\(\Pi_n\\) of  partitions,  which we show possesses many of the well-known properties of  \\(\Pi_n\\).   In particular, we prove these intervals are EL-shellable, we compute the M\"obius invariant  in terms of rooted trees, we find combinatorial bases for homology and cohomology, and we give an explicit sign twisted \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-module isomorphism from cohomology to the multilinear component of the free Lie algebra with two compatible brackets.  We  also show that the characteristic polynomial of \\(\Pi_n^w\\) has  a nice factorization analogous to that of  \\(\Pi_n\\).
