We present exponential generating function analogues to two classical identities involving the 
ordinary generating function of the complete homogeneous symmetric functions. After a suitable 
specialization the new identities reduce to identities involving the first and second order 
Eulerian polynomials. The study of these identities led us to consider a family of symmetric 
functions associated with the Stirling permutations introduced by Gessel and Stanley. In 
particular, we define certain type statistics on Stirling permutations that refine the statistics of 
descents, ascents and plateaux and we show that their refined versions are equidistributed 
generalizing a result of B&oacute;na.
The definition of this family of symmetric functions extends to the generality of \\(r\\)-Stirling 
permutations or \\(r\\)-multipermutations. We discuss some ocurrences of these symmetric functions in 
the cases of  \\(r=1\\)  and \\(r=2\\) .
