We study colored generalizations of the symmetric algebra and its Koszul dual, the exterior algebra. 
The symmetric group \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\) acts on the multilinear components of these algebras. While \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\) 
acts trivially on the multilinear components of the colored symmetric algebra, we use poset topology techniques to 
understand the representation on its Koszul dual. We introduce an \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-poset of weighted subsets that 
we call the weighted boolean algebra and we prove that the multilinear components of the colored exterior 
algebra are \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-isomorphic to the top cohomology modules of its maximal intervals. We use a technique of 
Sundaram to compute group representations on Cohen-macaulay posets to give a generating formula for the 
Frobenius series of the colored exterior algebra. We exploit that formula to find an explicit expression 
for the expansion of the corresponding representations in terms of irreducible \\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-representations. 
We show that the two colored Koszul dual algebras are Koszul in the sense of Priddy et al.
