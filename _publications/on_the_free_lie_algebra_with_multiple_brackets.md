We consider the poset of weighted partitions \\(\Pi_n^w\\),  introduced by Dotsenko and Khoroshkin in 
their study of a certain pair of dual operads.   The maximal intervals of  \\(\Pi_n^w\\) provide a 
generalization of the lattice \\(\Pi_n\\) of  partitions,  which we show possesses many of the
well-known properties of \\(\Pi_n\\). In particular,  we prove these intervals are EL-shellable, 
we show that the M\"obius invariant of each maximal interval is given up to sign by the number of
rooted trees on on node set \\(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\\) having a fixed number of descents,  we
find combinatorial bases for homology and cohomology, and we give an explicit sign twisted
\\(\mathfrak{S}_n\\)-module isomorphism from cohomology to the multilinear component of the free 
Lie algebra with two compatible brackets.  We  also show thatthe characteristic polynomial of 
\\(\Pi_n^w\\) has a nice factorization analogous to that of  \\(\Pi_n\\).
