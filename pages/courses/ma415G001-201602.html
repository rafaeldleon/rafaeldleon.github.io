 			<h2>Lectures</h2>
 			Monday, Wednesday and Fridays 1:00pm-1:50pm CB 339. <br>
 			<h2>Literature</h2>
 			<em>A First Course in Discrete Mathematics.</em> Ian Anderson.
 			<h2>Course Contents</h2>
 			This course is a basic course in the theory of counting and graph theory. Counting. Subsets and binomial coefficients.
 			Partitions and Stirling numbers. Permutations and permutation statistics. Fibonacci and Catalan numbers. 
 			The inclusion-exclusion principle.
 			Recurrences. Generating functions. Graphs. Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles. Graph colouring. 
 			Most of chapters 1 to 6 from Anderson's book.
 			
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (30%)</h3>
 			There will be 2 tests. These will be announced at least one week in advance.
 			<h3>Final (30%)</h3>
 			There will be a comprehensive final to be worth 30%.
 			<h3>Homework and Quizzes(40%)</h3>
 			There will be a set of problems to be handed in at the end of every week. To work on the homework problems is
 			crucial for your understanding of the material presented in class. Be sure to separate enough time each week
 			to think and write your solutions.  <em>It is recommended that you think and attempt every problem on your own before
 			seeking any help</em>. You are encouraged to discuss the material of the course with your classmates, however you must 
 			write your own solutions using your own words. There can be unannounced quizzes that will count towards your homework grade.
 			
 			<h3>Problem Sessions</h3>
 			There will be various in-class problem sessions during the semester whose goal is to reinforce the concepts learned 
 			during a given week. During the problem sessions you are strongly encouraged to share what you have learned and 
 			to learn from your fellow class mates (share and learn).<br>
 			
 			<h3>Suggested problems</h3>
 			There will be some additional suggested problems. These problems will be assigned after some of the
 			classes and also posted in the web page of the course.<br>

			<h2>Calculators Policy</h2>
			Calculators are not allowed in quizzes, tests or the final exam.
				
			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
			Students should consult the students rights and responsibilities outlined in the 
			<a href="http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/index.html">Student Code of Conduct.</a> 
			Any offense to the Code of Conduct will result in a grade of "E" for the course and a referral to 
			the Dean of Students.
			
			<h2>Excused Absences</h2>
			University Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 defines the following acceptable reasons for an ”excused absence” from class:
			<ul>
			<li>Serious illness (must be documented by doctor’s excuse)</li>
			<li>Illness or death of a family member</li>
			<li>University-related trips (must be documented by a letter from sponsor)</li>
			<li>Major religious holidays</li>
			<li>Other circumstances that your instructor finds to be ”reasonable cause for nonattendence”</li>
			</ul>
			Students should notify the instructor of an excused absence prior to the absence whenever 
			possible and complete all work prior to the absence (unless for illness or for the illness or
			death of a family member).
 			
			<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
			Students with documented physical‚ learning‚ or temporary disabilities may receive assistance and support 
			from the <a href="http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/">Disability Resource Center</a>.
			It is recommended that students contact the Disability Resource Center early to request specific assistance 
			so that the required medical or psychological documentation can be reviewed and reasonable accommodations 
			can be provided from the beginning of class work in order to achieve the greatest benefit to the student.

			<h2>Changes to this Syllabus</h2>
			This syllabus may have some changes during the semester. It is responsibility of the students to visit frequently
			the webpage of the course for up to date information.
