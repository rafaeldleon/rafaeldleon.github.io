 			<h2>Lectures</h2>
 			Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9:05AM-9:55AM MM 316. <br>
 			<h2>Literature</h2>
 			<em>PRECALCULUS: CONCEPTS THROUGH FUNCTIONS. 2nd edition </em> SULLIVAN & SULLIVAN.
 			
 			<h2>Prerrequisite</h2>
 			Minimum Math SAT score of 580 or ACT Math score of 25 or adequate score on the Mathematics 
 			Placement Exam or passing grade in <a href="http://www.math.miami.edu/undr/descriptions.htm#101#101">MTH 101</a>.
 			
 			<h2>Description</h2>
 			This course covers topics in algebra, providing students with the fundamentals of precalculus. 
 			This course is intended for students who will eventually take Calculus. Not open to students
 			with credit in <a href="http://www.math.miami.edu/undr/descriptions.htm#105#105" name="">MTH 105</a>.
 			
 			<h2>Topics</h2>
 			This course provides a concentration on functions and their applications, including function 
 			notation, finding the domain and range of functions, implicit functions, shifts of basic 
 			functions, operations on functions; graphs of linear functions, absolute value functions, 
 			polynomial functions, rational functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions; 
 			defining the inverse function and finding the inverse of one-to-one functions. 
 			
 			<h2>Required course materials</h2>
 			Students will be required to use MyMathLab in this course. Homework and other graded assignments
 			will be completed in MyMathLab.  For your convenience a MyMathLab access code has been bundled 
 			with the textbook and is available at the UM Bookstore.<br><br>

			Students will need to purchase one of the following:<br>

			<ol type="a">
			<li>Text bundled with MyMathLab Access code: 	ISBN-10:0321704347</li>
			<li>MyMathLab Student Access Kit:	ISBN-10: 032119991X</li>
			</ol>

			You may also purchase the MyMathLab access code on the MyMathLab website:  
			<a href="http://www.coursecompass.com/">www.coursecompass.com</a>.  
			<br><br>
			Your instructor will provide you with the course code for MyMathLab.  Purchase of the textbook 
			is optional since all of the textbook pages are included in the MyMathLab access.
 
 			<h2>Notebooks</h2>
 			Students are expected to keep an organized notebook for class notes and for homework.  
 			Although homework is submitted on-line and graded, it is extremely helpful to have the 
 			homework problems worked out in your notebook in order to refer to them when preparing 
 			for an exam.
 			
 			<h2>Calculators Policy</h2>
			A basic scientific calculator may be used in this course and will be useful in certain chapters
			of the text.  Calculators that are programmable or have graphing or alphanumeric capabilities 
			will NOT be permitted.
			
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			Final grades for the course will be based on a total of 750 points.
 			<h3>Tests and Assignments</h3>
 			There will be four 50-minute exams during the semester.  Each exam will be worth 100 points, 
 			contributing 400 points to the total.<br><br>
			MTH 107 EXAM SCHEDULE - SPRING 2011<br>
 			EXAM #1 - FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11th <br>
			EXAM #2 - FRIDAY, MARCH 4th<br>
			EXAM #3 - FRIDAY, APRIL 1st <br>
			EXAM #4 - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27th<br><br>
			Material to be covered on the exams will be announced in class.<br><br>
			Graded assignments will contribute 100 points to the total.  These assignments will be posted 
			in MyMathLab and are to be completed online.<br>
			
			<h3>Final</h3>
			The final exam will be a comprehensive, open ended exam and will be worth 250 points. The final 
			exam for MTH 107 has been scheduled Friday, MAY 6th, 2011 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM (location to be announced)
			<br><br>
			
			<h3>Makeup Policy</h3>
			Any student who cannot take an exam on the specified date for a legitimate and documented reason
			must make arrangements with their instructor to take the exam prior to that date.  No exams will
			be given after the specified test date.<br><br>
			
			<h3>Grading Scale</h3>
				The grading scale is as follows:		<br>			
 			<table class="ui-widget ui-widget-content" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1" frame="box" rules="all"> 				
 				<thead>
					<tr class="ui-widget-header "><th>Score</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody align="center">
					<tr><td>690 - 750</td><td>A</td></tr>
					<tr><td>670 - 689</td><td>A-</td></tr>
					<tr><td>655 - 669</td><td>B+</td></tr>
					<tr><td>615 - 654</td><td>B</td></tr>
					<tr><td>595 - 614</td><td>B-</td></tr>
					<tr><td>580 - 594</td><td>C+</td></tr>
					<tr><td>540 - 579</td><td>C</td></tr>

			<h3>Bonus Points</h3>
			Each student may earn up to 30 extra points by completing several assignments as determined 
			by the individual instructor. 
			
			<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
			Attendance is required and will be recorded daily.  Students will be allowed a total of 5
			absences.  For each absence over these five, 5 points will be deducted from the student's
			total points.  Excessive tardiness will be treated similarly.
			
			<h2><a href="http://www.miami.edu/index.php/student_life/policies_and_procedures/honor_code/"> Honor Code</a></h2>
			The Honor Code will appear on each exam.  Students should consult the Undergraduate Bulletin
			for details of the <a href="http://www6.miami.edu/dean-students/pdf/undergrad_honorcode.pdf">Honor Code.</a> Any infraction of the Honor Code will result in a grade of "F"
			for the course and a referral to the Dean of Students.
			
			<h2>Supplemental Instruction</h2>
			
			The Math Lab is located in Room 304 of the Ungar Building.  Tutoring is available to all 
			students enrolled in this course.  Tutors are available at the Math Lab on a walk-in basis.<br>
