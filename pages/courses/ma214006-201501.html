 			<h2>Lectures</h2>
 			Monday, Wednesday and Fridays 1:00PM-1:50PM CB 349. <br>
 			<h2>Literature</h2>
 			<em>Elementary Differential Equations</em> William E. Boyce / Richard C. DiPrima. 10th edition.
 			<h2>Course Contents</h2>
 			MA 214 is a course in ordinary differential equations. Emphasis is on first (Chapter 2) and second order equations 
 			(Chapter 3) and applications. 
 			The course includes series solutions of second order equations (Chapter 5) and Laplace transform methods (Chapter 6).
 			Most of chapters 1,2,3,5 and 6 from Boyce-DiPrima's book.
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (50%)</h3>
 			There will be 2 tests. These will be announced at least one week in advance.
 			<h3>Final (30%)</h3>
 			There will be a comprehensive final to be worth 30% on Wednesday 5/6/2015 1:00-3:00 P.M..
 			<h3>Homework and Quizzes (20%)</h3>
 			There will be <strong>online homework</strong> to be handed in every week.<br>
 			The online homework will be assigned and completed	in 
 			<a href="http://webwork2.ms.uky.edu/webwork2/ma214-06/">Webwork (http://webwork2.ms.uky.edu/webwork2/ma214-06/)</a>. 
 			Your username is your LinkBlue ID (use only capital letters), and your password is your student ID number (8 digits).	<br>
			<br>
 			There may also be some additional written homework. These problems will be assigned after some of the
 			classes and also posted in the web page of the course.<br>
 			There will be <strong>(unannounced) quizzes on some Wednesdays.</strong><br>
 			Homework and quizzes are equally weighted for the remaining 20% of the grade.

			<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
			The university and the department of mathematics offer tutoring without appointment at 
			<a href="http://www.mathskeller.com/" >The Mathskeller </a>.
			<a href="http://www.uky.edu/AE/">The Study</a> also offers peer tutoring.
			
			<h2>Calculators Policy</h2>
			Students may use a graphing calculator on exams but may not use any electronic device with the ability 
			to do symbolic computations such as the TI-89, TI-92, HP48 or a computer. 
				
			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
			Students should consult the students rights and responsibilities outlined in the 
			<a href="http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/index.html">Student Code of Conduct.</a> 
			Any offense to the Code of Conduct will result in a grade of "E" for the course and a referral to 
			the Dean of Students.
			
			<h2>Excused Absences</h2>
			University Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 defines the following acceptable reasons for an ”excused absence” from class:
			<ul>
			<li>Serious illness (must be documented by doctor’s excuse)</li>
			<li>Illness or death of a family member</li>
			<li>University-related trips (must be documented by a letter from sponsor)</li>
			<li>Major religious holidays</li>
			<li>Other circumstances that your instructor finds to be ”reasonable cause for nonattendence”</li>
			</ul>
			Students should notify the instructor of an excused absence prior to the absence whenever 
			possible and complete all work prior to the absence (unless for illness or for the illness or
			death of a family member).
 			
			<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
			Students with documented physical‚ learning‚ or temporary disabilities may receive assistance and support 
			from the <a href="http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/DisabilityResourceCenter/">Disability Resource Center</a>.
			It is recommended that students contact the Disability Resource Center early to request specific assistance 
			so that the required medical or psychological documentation can be reviewed and reasonable accommodations 
			can be provided from the beginning of class work in order to achieve the greatest benefit to the student.

			<h2>Changes to this Syllabus</h2>
			This syllabus can have some changes during the semester. It is responsibility of the students to visit frequently
			the webpage of the course for up to date information.
