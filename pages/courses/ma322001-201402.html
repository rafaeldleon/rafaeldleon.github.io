 			<h2>Lectures</h2>
 			Monday, Wednesday and Fridays 9:00AM-9:50AM CB 349. <br>
 			<h2>Literature</h2>
 			<em>Linear Algebra and its applications.</em> David C. Lay.
 			<h2>Course Contents</h2>
 			The solution of simultaneous linear equations. Matrix algebra. Determinants. Vector spaces.
 			Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Inner product spaces and least squares approximation.
 			Most of chapters 1 to 6 from Lay's book.
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (50%)</h3>
 			There will be 3 tests. These will be announced
 			at least one week in advance. The test with lower score will be dropped and the other two
 			remaining will be worth 50% towards the final grade. There will be no make-up tests.
 			<h3>Final (30%)</h3>
 			There will be a comprehensive final to be worth 30% on Wednesday 12/17/2014 8:00-10:00 A.M..
 			<h3>Homework and Quizzes (20%)</h3>
 			There will be both online homework and written homework to be handed in every week. 	<br>
 			The online homework will be assigned and completed	in 
 			<a href="http://">WeBWorK</a>. 
 			Your username is your LinkBlue ID (use only capital letters), and your password is your student ID number (8 digits).	<br>
 			The written homework will be posted after every class in <a href="./homeworkma322001-201402.html">Link</a>.	<br>
 			The homework posted during each week will be due at the beginning of the class of Friday of the following week.
 			Your written homework should:
 			<ul><li>Be clean and organized. Homework that cannot be understood to be graded will be awarded 0 points.</li>
 			<li>Be your own work. A reasonable amount of collaboration is expected but the written solutions should be your
 			own and use your own words.</li>
 			<li>Show all your work. There will be no credit for correct answers if you do not show the steps you took to
 			arrive to a solution. Partial credit will be awarded for your work even in the case you arrive to an incorrect answer.</li> 			
 			</ul>

			<br>
 			There may also be some additional homework problems without any due date but that you should
 			complete in order to train the concepts given in class. Some of these problems could
 			appear in the quizzes, tests and the final. These problems will be assigned after some of the
 			classes and also posted in the web page of the course.<br>
 			There will be (unannounced) quizzes on some Wednesdays.<br>
 			Homework and quizzes are equally weighted for the remaining 20% of the grade.
