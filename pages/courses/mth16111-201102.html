 			Thursdays 6:25PM-7:40PM MM 202 <br>
 			<h2>Literature</h2>
 			<em>Essential Calculus.</em> James Stewart.
 			<h2>Course Contents</h2>
 			Limits and continuity, derivatives and applications, the definite integral and applications.<br>
 			Chapters 1,2,3,4 and 7 from Stewart's book.
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (50%)</h3>
 			There will be 4 tests. These will be given on Thursdays and will be announced
 			at least one week in advance. The test with lower score will be dropped and the other three
 			remaining will be worth 50% towards the final grade. There will be no make-up tests.
 			<h3>Final (30%)</h3>
 			There will be a comprehensive final to be worth 30%.
 			<h3>Homework and Quizzes (20%)</h3>
 			There will be homework to be handed in every week. The homework will be assigned and completed
 			in <a href="http://www.webassign.net/">WebAssign (http://www.webassign.net/)</a> . The homework posted during each week will be due the Friday of the following week.
			An accesscode for WebAssign is bundled with the new textbook purchased through the UM Bookstore.
			To get enrolled in the course in WebAssign you should use the class key: <b>miami 6109 7970</b>

			<br>
 			There may also be some additional homework problems without any due date but that you should
 			complete in order to train the concepts given in class. Some of these problems could
 			appear in the quizzes, tests and the final. These problems will be assigned after some of the
 			classes and also posted in the web page of the course.<br>
 			There will be (unannounced) quizzes on some Wednesdays.<br>
 			Homework and quizzes are equally weighted for the remaining 20% of the grade.
