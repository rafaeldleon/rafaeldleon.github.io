 			<h2>Literature</h2>

 			<h2>Course Contents</h2>
 			
 			
 			<span>
        	Combinatorics is the area of mathematics that studies the enumeration and structure of families of discrete objects. <br><br>
 			This course will be comprised of two parts: <br><br>
 			In the first part of the course we will give an introduction to the theory of combinatorial enumeration, 
 			the theory of partially ordered sets (posets) and some basic concepts in graph theory. 
 			From the enumerative point of view we will cover the basic enumeration principles, permutations and factorial numbers, 
 			subsets and binomial coefficients, compositions and weak compositions, set partitions and Stirling numbers, 
 			Fibonacci numbers and Catalan numbers, recurrences, generating functions, and the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE). 
 			From the theory of partially ordered sets, we will cover basic definitions, lattices, Möbius functions, 
 			the Möbius Inversion Theorem. 
 			We will also cover the basic definition of a graph, the graph coloring problem and the chromatic polynomial. 
 			The first part of the course will be in English, however, we will only assume a basic level in the language. 
 			The main goal is to provide the students with the skill to have access to the literature that in general is published in English.<br>
 			<br>
 			The second part of the course will be centered on giving an introduction to how research is done in Combinatorics. Here the students 
 			will have the opportunity to work in small parts of a current research project where we will study an application of the concepts previously 
 			studied in class. The students will have the opportunity to make computational experiments, propose conjectures and work towards proving 
 			such conjectures.	</span>	
 			
 			<h2>Examination and Grading</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (40%)</h3>
 			There will be 2 tests of 20% each. These will be announced at least one week in advance.
 			<h3>Homework (30%)</h3>
 			There will be three problem sets (each worth 10%) to be handed in at the end of each term. To work on the homework problems is
 			crucial for your understanding of the material presented in class. Be sure to separate enough time each week
 			to think and write your solutions.<em> It is recommended that you think and attempt every problem on your own before
 			seeking any help</em>. You are encouraged to discuss the material of the course with your classmates, however you must 
 			write your own solutions using your own words. Each homework will be graded by a random selection of a few problems (5%) and by a quiz (5%) 
 			where you should write your own solution for a randomly selected problem from the set.
 			<h3>Final Research Project (30%)</h3>
 			In the final project we will select one or two problems that we will work as a group. Specific parts of the project will be then assigned
 			to smaller subgroups. The goal of the subgroup is to understand the problem, generate computational data and draw conclusions that might
 			allow you to propose conjectural statements. You will try to prove some of these statements using the skills acquired in the first part of the course.
 			
 			<h3>Problem Sessions</h3>
 			There will be various in-class problem sessions during the semester whose goal is to reinforce the concepts learned 
 			during a given week. During the problem sessions you are strongly encouraged to share what you have learned and 
 			to learn from your fellow class mates (share and learn).<br>
