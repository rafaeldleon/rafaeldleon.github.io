 			<h2>Course content</h2>
 			<span>
        	The notion of order is a fundamental idea that is pervasive across almost every subject in mathematics. 
            The formal study of partially ordered sets (posets) can be traced back to the nineteenth century but it had its major development 
            in the twentieth century after the work of  Birkhoff, among others, in lattice theory; Weisner, Hall and Ward in the theory of M&ouml;bius 
            functions; and the seminal work of Gian-Carlo Rota in 1964 that gave the foundation to what is known today as poset topology, 
            a field that studies interactions between poset theory, topology, algebra and enumeration. </span>		
 			
 			<h2>Grade distribution</h2>
 			<h3>Tests (30%)</h3>
 			There will be 2 tests. These will be announced at least one week in advance.
 			<h3>Final project and presentation(30%)</h3>
 			<h3>Homework(40%)</h3>
 			There will be a set of problems to be handed in every two weeks. To work on the homework problems is
 			crucial for your understanding of the material presented in class. Be sure to separate enough time each week
 			to think and write your solutions.  <em>It is recommended that you think and attempt every problem on your own before
 			seeking any help</em>. You are encouraged to discuss the material of the course with your classmates, however you must 
 			write your own solutions using your own words. 
 			
 			<h3>Problem Sessions</h3>
 			There will be various in-class problem sessions during the semester whose goal is to reinforce the concepts learned 
 			during a given week. During the problem sessions you are strongly encouraged to share what you have learned and 
 			to learn from your fellow class mates (share and learn).<br>
 			
 			
 		<h3>Suggested problems</h3>
 			There will be some additional suggested problems. These problems will be assigned after some of the
 			classes and also posted in the web page of the course.<br>
